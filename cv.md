## briefly about me
My name is Semen, as you already read. I am 16 years old, and on July 31st I will be 17.

I study in the 11th grade of the district gymnasium, in Belarus. I have an average grade of 9.3.

I want to become a front-end developer. I enjoy studying at RS School. Before this, I studied a little bit of Python.

I love it when everything is logical and understandable. I am a perfectionist myself, but not too much.

I just like it when everything is beautiful. Good luck to everyone.
